# Game-of-life
This repository contains files of the Game of life. I created my file in processing.


To accomplish the given scenarios, 


  I created a grid using 2D arrays
  
  
  and filled it with 0 and 1
  
  
   I filled 1 accross horizontally leaving a space of each row to achieve the initial state given in scenario 6
  
  
  I filled the grid with black squares = live cells
  
  
  
  scenario 6 - can be seen as the game completes its cycles
